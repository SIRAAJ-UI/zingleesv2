                        <p class="text-layer">
                            A vast majority across the globe, irrespective of social, cultural and economic disparities has pinned all their hopes for their children on education. It would not be an overstatement to say that not just the future of the child, but that of the society, nation and the planet depends on the education available to the child.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-layer">
                            While education is a social responsibility, education itself has the responsibility to instill hope and confidence in students. While considering the reasons for the increasing ‘school drop-out’ ratio, one of the critical factors has been the failure of education to engross learners. The format of education has been rigid and linear and it has not been able to adapt to the need, strengths and weakness of every child. In a terribly distracted environment, the need to ensure education that engages students, the need for education that caters to every individual sitting in the classroom, is essential.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-layer">
                            Every report on assessing the learning outcomes of children reveals that at least more than one-third of the class is missing out on the learning. It is sad but true that the casualties arising out of inadequate education are more in number than in any other epidemic or pandemic. The most worrying factor is that the majority of the schools and public are insensitive to and ignorant about the whole issue.
                           </p> 
                        <p class="text-layer">
                            Parents and schools are obsessed with marks. The mushrooming coaching centres feed on this insecurity and stress on greater scores for better choices. Education has been missing its purpose and that cannot be taken lightly. Understanding the learning crisis prevalent across the globe, the regulatory bodies and schools have started emphasising ‘Learning Outcomes’.

                            With a clear understanding of the purpose of education, and a deeper understanding of the implementation issues, we at ‘Zing Learner Evaluation & Empowerment Solutions (Zinglees)’ have come up with offerings that bridge the gaps in the traditional practices and thereby ensure learning for every child.

                            To support schools in moving from the current formal examination system to a purposeful evaluation system, where the instructor/teacher is assisted with reports which will give them a clear picture of the understanding of every child. These services are also available to parents/guardians who desire to get an independent external evaluation done for their child.

                            To support schools with class-wise, subject-wise Learning Achievement Plans. It has to be understood that the new deliverables defined by the regulatory bodies demand a new pedagogy to achieve them in full. We have structured and organised ‘Learning Achievement Plans’ with effective and innovative teaching of every concept and covering the smallest detail. These plans focus on grooming the competence of every child in every concept in every subject and not just on marks

                            To support schools in all their technological needs and dependencies. Technology has begun to play a critical role in every sector including education. Any new solution inside or outside school premises must be built around technology for today’s students. Zinglees supports schools either with readymade open-source or paid solutions available or customises them to the needs of the schools.
